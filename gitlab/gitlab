branch testing using the file git lab,

Added the line on remote server to check the difference between "$ git pull origin" 
and "$ git fetch origin" then "$ git checkout" to other branch to make sure that our unsaved
changes to staging area won't get overridded. 


I am making changes to gitlab file in remote server, to see will it override the unsaved changes in
working directory. if so I shoudn't see below line,

Now I am not saving my file to staging area to see will it override the unsaved changes.
