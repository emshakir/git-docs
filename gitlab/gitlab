branch testing using the file git lab,

Added the line on remote server to check the difference between "$ git pull origin" 
and "$ git fetch origin" then "$ git checkout" to other branch to make sure that our unsaved
changes to staging area won't get overridden. 

I am making changes to gitlab file in remote server, to see will it override 
the unsaved changes in working directory. if so I shouldn't see below line,

changes to staging area won't get overridden.

Now I am not saving my file to staging area to see will it override the 
unsaved changes. 

Now I am making changes to see how "$ git fetch origin" and "$ git checkout" works together.

Adding the changes in remote file to see changes made from remote server using "$ git fetch origin".
