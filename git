Git is a Distributed version control system or software tool used for source 
code management in software development, developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 
who developed LINUX, designed to track changes in the source code, enabling 
multiple developers to work together on non-linear development and revert back 
to previous versions for every small to very large projects with speed and 
efficiency.

With Git each developer will have an entire copy of the code on their local 
repository along the history of the commits made and also the source code can
be tracked by other developers by creating a connection between multiple 
developers.

Git was originally developed as a command line tool, it provides a command line 
interface with which we can control the system. To work with it we need to 
understand the workflow and different commands to execute the workflow.

P.S. We can track any file with git .java, .py, .js, .txt, .xlsx, .jpg, .png etc.,

Below Git Commands will help you to understand the work flow and keep 
track of your files.

We need to go to the root of the directory/folder for which we need to create 
a repository or initialize to git, you may use the below basic command to get to
root folder or to move to specific folder.

===================================================================================

$ pwd                               -   To know the current directory you are in.

$ cd or $ cd ~                      -   To navigate to your home directory

$ cd D:                             -   To navigate to D directory

$ cd folder_name/folder_name/       -   To navigate to specific folder
 
$ cd ..                             -   To navigate to previous folder

$ cd ../..                          -   TO navigate to two previous folder

================================================================================
1. $ git init

This command turns your current folder into git repository and creates a .git folder
inside your current folder indicating that this will be a git repository.

Once you use this command it will respond you back with,
Initialized empty Git repository in /directory_name/folder_name/.git/

P.S. .git folder will have git internals and project meta data, by default it will
be hidden.

================================================================================
2. $ ls -a 

You can see the number of available folders in your current folder along with 
the hidden fields.

P.S. "$ ls" - this command is used to display only non-hidden fields.

NOTE: This will only initialize a git repository in your working folder but not 
start tracking your files yet, we have to add files to let git start tracking our
files, though we can see the files which are tracked and which are not.

================================================================================
3. $ git status 

You can see the list of untracked files in your working folder.
